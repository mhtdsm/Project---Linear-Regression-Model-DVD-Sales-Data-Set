Project â€“ Create a Linear Regression Model for DVD sales data set

Create a Linear Regression Model for DVD sales data set. The data set contains the following
details:
1. Advertising: The budget spent on advertising.
2. Sales: Number of copies sold
3. Plays: Number of plays on Radio Mirchi
4. Attractiveness: Attractiveness of the brand (rating scale from 1 to 10; 1 being the worst and 10 being the best)

Imagine that the CEO of a DVD player sales company approaches you in order to predict the sale of DVDs. He also provides you the data such as the advertising budget (in thousands), sales (in thousands), number of times the song is played on the radio channel, Radio Mirchi per week and the attractiveness of the brand (rated on a scale of 1 to 10 by an independent agency).
